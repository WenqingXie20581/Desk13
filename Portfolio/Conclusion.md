## Evaluation of design

When it came to the design of the project we felt... with this in mind, we will now evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and potential extensions of the design before reflecting on the lessons we've learned about this aspect of the project.


## Reflection on working practices

We now turn to our working practices...


### Our working practices


### Evaluation of working practices



## Reflection of success of project

There have been many successes throughout the duration of this unit.


### How well did our project fulfill the brief?


### Were objectives met?


## Impact of Covid-19


The outbreak of COVID-19 in March, and the subsequent lockdowns running up to the end of April affected each us in many ways. 

  1. Communication inconvenience. Because the members of the group are located in different cities, we cannot conduct efficient face-to-face communication and we had to talk our work by **Microsoft Teams** . However, many technical-related details cannot be explained clearly only by online communication, which has brought a lot of trouble to our project. Every weeks we spend not less than 8 hours in communication , as we more and more understand each other , this difficulty was overcome finally. 

  2. Working Environment. Due to the severe COVID -19 epidemic, we could not go to the campus library to study together and we have no chioce but to work in our homes seperately. Unfortunately, the home environment is not suitable for work. Our team members often complain that the home is too noisy so that we can’t concentrate on work!


  3. Teaching support. Because all the courses in this semester are online teaching, we can't have face-to-face communication with professors and in-depth discussion of complex Internet technical details, so that we have to spend more time searching for related problem solutions on the website. This undoubtedly greatly increases our learning costs and reduces the efficiency and quality of our work.


  4. Infrastructure. Due to isolation from university infrastructure the team was heavily reliant on local machines and internet being usable.Some team members' laptops are low in configuration. In addition, the internet speed of the home is unstable, which brings great trouble to our work.What's more frustrating is that these hardware problems cannot be solved by our knowledge and usually we can only wait patiently for the system to run slowly , which makes us desperate.

 

## Social and ethical implications

In this part , we will focous on the discussion of social and ethical implications of our app.

In the previous part, we have talked about the social implications of the our product many times and I will simply repeate here. According to the  previous survey, we have learned that COVID-19 make a large number of people haved to face unemployment ，financial crisis and spiritual crisis. Our product can teach people to cook their own meals according to the recipe and help these people who are suffering financial crisis reduce living cost, more importantly, the app encourage people to share their favorite recipes, which can promote people's communication, enrich people's spiritual world, and heal the mental trauma caused by the COVID-19.

Now,we will focus on the ethical implications of the product.Our product is a gourmet food and social app. As the developer, we think that we have the responsibility to protect the privacy of every user. Last term, our computer science introduction's professor teach us that our products are supposed to protect the users's privacy,  which is a fundamental moral human right - a right that preserves autonomy and dignity which is of paramount importance when dealing with stakeholders. Therefore,we put customer privacy protection at an important position in the design of our products. In order to safely protect the privacy of users，we used the ‘The International Data Privacy Principles' (IDPPs) as the core guide to managing personal data.
At the same time, we fully consider the personal wishes of users. If users do not want us to keep their personal data, we will delete all private information in accordance with user requirements  at any time. In addition, we have adopted a variety of encryption methods and algorithms such as secure-sockets-layer (SSL) and MD5 algorithms to protect the data of our app.Although there are no bug-free apps in the world, we believe that through our strong tests, our products are capable of protecting users’ privacy from being leaked.

## Future work

Due to our time constrains,in our project we rushed through big chunks of what would be a normal design process and we have to admit that we skipped a lot of small content. In this part, we will plan future work to make our products more competitive. More importantly，Wei Wei was an excellent student majoring in finance when he was a undergraduate and now he hopes to build a complete business model for our app. Therefore, as for the future work,he thinks there are  two things we have to do.

On the one hand, we are supposed to consider some additional features that would make our product more viable, so after analyzing the current apps of the same type, we think that we need to add **consumer market**, **Social Network Service**, and interesting **tasks** and **competition mechanisms**.These functions must be completed simultaneously and work together. It is meaningless to add one of these functions separately. 

Firstly，our app must have a complete consumer market. In our consumer market, users can use the special virtual currency we provide (hereinafter referred to as food coins) to purchase related goods. The goods that can be purchased by food coins include virtual good provided on our website, such as VIP privilege (the VIP users can enjoy exclusive discounts, exclusive titles and recipes and will be placed in a more prominent position on the website...) In addition, the goods also include real goods such as Kitchen furniture including Pressure Cooker, Insulate Food Container, Air Fryer and food materials including potatoes, broccoli, chicken breast,etc, which can be provided by the merchants cooperated with us. At this stage, there are two ways to obtain food coins. For the most ordinary users, they can get food coins by uploading recipes. In addition, uploading recipes that we require or uploading recipes that is liked by others can help users get more food coins, which can also encourage players to share interesting recipes with others and enhance the website’s user stickiness. What's more , for wealthy users, sharing recipes and completing designated tasks to earn food coins is not attractive enough. They could purchase it using real currency through our website, which make us have to develop a secure payment system using an existing online money transfer service like Pay-pal. Although these functions are not easy, it will bring us considerable benefits if we can complete them.

Secondly, Social Network Service is necessary. Although we have implemented part of the social functions, we allow users to click the like bottom to other users' recipes, this is far from enough for a mature app. Therefore, in order to improve our social network service, we plan to add the following functions. First of all，we plan to allow users to comment on other user’s recipes and increase the friend function. Users who like similar recipes can become friends, discuss their favorite recipes with each other, and even meet in real life to try interesting new recipes together. In addition, we also plan to build an online communication community based on the needs of users for different recipes. Users can discuss specific recipes in their own communities. If there are many users interested in the same type of recipes, we will consider contacting an experienced chef to explain the recipe via video on our web.  In our research, social network functions are currently ignored by most food apps, so we believe that reliable social network services can become our unique advantage and build our core competitiveness. 

Thirdly, in order to enhance our app's attraction, we will add the task mechanism and the competition mechanism. The task system can improve the interest of the website app help users gain the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. We plan to design different recipe tasks according to the actual situation of each country. Taking China as an example, China’s task recipes include roast Beijing duck, saute diced chicken with hot peppers,braised common carp,saute fish slices with bamboo shoots,saute chops with sweet&sour sauce. If you upload the recipe belong to the task recipe, you will get double food coin as a reward. In addition，competition mechanism play an significant role in the web app. We believe that the introduction of a competition mechanism can make our app more viable. We decided to implement the competition mechanism by setting different points for users. The points are determined by the online time and the quality of the uploaded recipes. Within each fixed period, the corresponding rewards will be given at the end of each period according to the points ranking, thus encouraging users to use our product more actively. We believe that  the task mechanism and the competition mechanism can make our products stand out in food apps

On the other hand, our  profit model can be divided into three main categories: advertising insertion, e-commerce platform sharing, and selling ingredients.

Firstly, Inserting advertisements is a common way to make money on websites. When the users enter the APP, we plan to show an advertising image about 3 seconds. The content is usually a partner’s furniture goods or a meal advertisement. By the way, we don’t want to insert a variety of advertisements, we only intend to insert these advertisements related to our website app. What's more, other places for insert advertisements are the edge of the page. However, in order to ensure a good user experience, there will be not many advertisement spaces. Now, we are considering whether to insert a three-second advertisement every hour, because we are not sure whether this will reduce user satisfaction.

Secondly, e-commerce platform sharing plays an important role in our website app's profit. According to the plan above, our app has complete consumer market, Social Network Service, and interesting tasks and competition mechanisms. Therefore, our app have great commercial potential. Our cooperative manufacturers are mainly divided into two categories, high-level household kitchenware manufacturers and cheap tableware manufacturers. Through our own consumer market, consumers can use food coin to buy these products. At the same time, through our online community function, users can discuss the quality of goods with each other, recommend suitable products to each other. Simply, we provide convenience to users ,help cooperative manufacturers to sell products, and get profit.

Thirdly, we can earn profit by selling ingredients and we think this will  be brand new profit model. Usually, food ingredients suppliers buy ingredients from farmers and sell them to consumers to earn the difference between price. However, now we have a large number of users who have a large demand for ingredients, so we plan to skip suppliers and buy ingredients directly from farmers. This can simplify the purchase process and help our users reduce the cost of ingredients. Since our purchase volume far exceeds that of ingredients suppliers, there is no doubt that we can buy food at a lower price, and then we plan to sell ingredients to our users at a price lower than that of ingredients suppliers, so that we and the users both can get benefits.

Finally, this is a simple SWOT analysis : 

|                                                              | Strengths ：The profit model is novel and the team is young and energetic | Weaknesses ：Members have insufficient experience and lack of funds |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Opportunities   ：Internet users increase and rapid development of e-commerce | SO : According to the unique profit model and the advantages of low labor costs, quickly complete the initial capital accumulation and improve core competitiveness | WO : Use profit to recruit experienced Internet programmers to improve website quality and security, and attract strategic investment |
| Threats ：Malicious competition among website food application | ST : Recruit legal consultants to prevent malicious competition and malicious mergers and acquisitions, use the law to protect our rights. Improve our consumer market, Social Network Service,  tasks mechanisms and competition mechanisms to Enhance core competitiveness. | WT : Retain technical talents with common goals and dreams.  |
