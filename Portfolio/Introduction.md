## Abstract

### Motivation
We are a group of young student who are curious about the Internet world. Last year, the Covid-19 epidemic affected everyone's lives and many people have to face unemployment, financial crisis, and loneliness caused by forced separation......  Therefore, we hope to create a single page app（SPA ）project to encourage people to share the food they enjoy, so as to strengthen the communication between users from different cultural backgrounds  and reduce people's loneliness. Additionally, interesting recipes can not only enrich people's lives, but also reduce people's living costs and help people get through financial crises. In a word, only nature can lift the virus,but we hope to fight the disaster brought by the epidemic through our project.
