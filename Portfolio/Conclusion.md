# Conclusion

In this final section, we will reflect on our app and what we have done. Firstly, we will reflect on our working practices,and clearly evaluate  our work. Then, We will reflect on the success of the project, with a focus on whether the brief and objectives were met. What's more, We will talk about the impact COVID-19 had on our project. finally, we will discuss the social and ethical implications of our app and look ahead to future work in terms of design, development and evaluation.

## Evaluation of design

When it came to the design of the project we felt... with this in mind, we will now evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and potential extensions of the design before reflecting on the lessons we've learned about this aspect of the project.


## Reflection on working practices

We now turn to our working practices...


### Our working practices


### Evaluation of working practices



## Reflection of success of project

There have been many successes throughout the duration of this unit.


### How well did our project fulfil the brief?


### Were objectives met?


## Impact of Covid-19


The outbreak of COVID-19 in March, and the subsequent lockdowns running up to the end of April affected each us in many ways. 

 1. Communication inconvenience. Because the members of the group are located in different cities, we cannot conduct efficient face-to-face communication and we had to talk our work by **Microsoft Teams** . However, many technical-related details cannot be explained clearly only by online communication, which has brought a lot of trouble to our project. Every weeks we spend not less than 8 hours in communication , as we more and more understand each other , this difficulty was overcome finally. 

 2. Working Environment. Due to the severe COVID -19 epidemic, we could not go to the campus library to study together and we have no choice but to work in our homes separately. Unfortunately, the home environment is not suitable for work. Our team members often complain that the home is too noisy so that we can’t concentrate on work!


 3. Teaching support. Because all the courses in this semester are online teaching, we can't have face-to-face communication with professors and in-depth discussion of complex Internet technical details, so that we have to spend more time searching for related problem solutions on the website. This undoubtedly greatly increases our learning costs and reduces the efficiency and quality of our work.


 4. Infrastructure. Due to isolation from university infrastructure the team was heavily reliant on local machines and Internet being usable. Some team members' laptops are low in configuration. In addition, the Internet speed of the home is unstable, which brings great trouble to our work. What's more frustrating is that these hardware problems cannot be solved by our knowledge and usually we can only wait patiently for the system to run slowly , which makes us desperate.

 

## Social and ethical implications

In this part , we will focus on the discussion of social and ethical implications of our app.

In the previous part, we have talked about the social implications of the our product many times and I will simply repeat here. According to the  previous survey, we have learned that COVID-19 make a large number of people have to face unemployment ，financial crisis and spiritual crisis. Our product can teach people to cook their own meals according to the recipe and help these people who are suffering financial crisis reduce living cost, more importantly, the app encourage people to share their favorite recipes, which can promote people's communication, enrich people's spiritual world, and heal the mental trauma caused by the COVID-19.

Now,we will focus on the ethical implications of the product. Our product is a gourmet food and social app. As the developer, we think that we have the responsibility to protect the privacy of every user. Last term, our computer science introduction's professor teach us that our products are supposed to protect the user's privacy,  which is a fundamental moral human right - a right that preserves autonomy and dignity which is of paramount importance when dealing with stakeholders. Therefore,we put customer privacy protection at an important position in the design of our products. In order to safely protect the privacy of users，we used the ‘The International Data Privacy Principles' (IDPPs) as the core guide to managing personal data.
At the same time, we fully consider the personal wishes of users. If users do not want us to keep their personal data, we will delete all private information in accordance with user requirements  at any time. In addition, we have adopted a variety of encryption methods and algorithms such as secure-sockets-layer (SSL) and MD5 algorithms to protect the data of our app. Although there are no bug-free apps in the world, we believe that through our strong tests, our products are capable of protecting users’ privacy from being leaked.

## Future work
Due to our time constrains,in our project we rushed through big chunks of what would be a normal design process and we have to admit that we skipped a lot of small content. In this part, we will plan future work to make our products more competitive.
