# Background and Motivation
In this section, we discuss the background literature, state-of-the-art survey and motivation and problem definition of the app. We start with the background literature about the impact of the COVID-19 on society and the social significance of food. We then go on to present our state of the art survey of current industry applications used to address these issues, lastly, we explain the problem definition behind our product.

## Background literature

In this section, we provide an overview of the background literature relating to impact from COVID-19 and the social significance of food social apps.

Firstly, the COVID-19 hit the world economy hard. Take the UK as an example, figure below shows the UK economy of quarter three (July – Sept) 2020 is still 9.7 per cent below its pre pandemic levels, with more than double the decline seen in the US and the EU. In quarter two (Apr – June) the UK economy decline of 20.4 per cent was steepest of all comparable countries and double the OECD average of 9.9%. Latest labour market stats show redundancies hit an all-time high of 314,000 in Jul-Sep 2020. Unemployment increased more this quarter than any other time on record.[[**1**]](#references). These figures point that a large number of people will be forced to face unemployment and financial crisis. As we all know, the total food expenditure accounts for a large proportion( about 15% - 30% ) of the total personal consumption expenditure,  so reducing food expenditure is a good way to reduce consumption. [[**2**]](#references)Therefore, these people who are suffering financial crisis have no choice but to cook their own food reduce the cost of living to get through this difficult time. What's more，due to the impact of the epidemic, many restaurants had to be closed and almost everyone is encouraged to stay at home in addition to buying essential daily necessities，therefore, cooking has become a skill that every people must master.[[**3**]](#references)

Secondly, This COVID-19 epidemic has aroused increasing social spiritual crisis. Patients, health professionals, and the general public are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. Psychological crisis intervention plays a pivotal role in the overall deployment of the disease control.[[**4**]](#references) According to the research from Uma Naidoo ,  food is a good way to relieve anxiety, more specifically, foods rich in zincsuch as oysters, cashews, liver, beef, and egg yolks have been linked to lowered anxiety. These “feel good” foods spur the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. They are a safe and easy first step in managing anxiety.[[**5**]](#references) So, the app that shares food can obviously help people under the Covid-19 epidemic relieve their mental stress. More significantly, sharing food on social apps can promote communication and understanding between people from different cultural background, enrich people's spiritual life and enhance people's spiritual strength, which is very important to help people go through this disaster.[[**6**]](#references)

## State of the art survey

We now turn to our state-of-the-art survey. We will show clearly a currently popular gourmet app -- **Paleo Plate**，an app that provides original and gluten-free diet recipes.

![background(3)](images/Background_and_Motivation/background(3).jpg)

 1. Product description：
    The paleo diet is one of the most popular diets currently popular in Europe and America. Its dietary philosophy is: modern people should imitate our ancestors' diet (avoid processed foods, sugar, dairy products and grains, and focus on eating meat, eggs and vegetables) to achieve true health. The paleo diet is widely used in weight loss and Treat various chronic diseases. This App provides paleo diet recipes, including meat, seafood and vegetables, and can provide a shopping list, which provides great convenience for paleo diet dieters and gluten-free dieters.

  ![background(4)](images/Background_and_Motivation/background(4).jpg)

 2. Target population：
      Paleo diet dieters, gluten-free dieters, and those interested in related diets.

 3. Core function：
      Provide more than 150 (still growing) original diet recipes (including meat, eggs, seafood and vegetables)
        Provide detailed food preparation ingredients and methods, and there is a picture display
        You can search for ingredients and find the corresponding recipe
        You can save recipes for later review
        Can share recipes to social platforms
        Provide a food list, you can check whether the food meets the standards of the paleo diet.

      ![background(5)](images/Background_and_Motivation/background(5).jpg)

 4. Use scenarios：
      People who follow the Primal Diet or gluten-free diet look for the corresponding diet recipes and follow the tutorials
        Restaurants or takeaways that follow the Primal Diet concept or serve gluten-free food draw from the recipes provided in the app
        Users share recipes with friends who are interested in trying the Primal Diet or gluten-free diet

 5. Business model： 
     The business model of this app is relatively simple ： provide in-app purchases to unlock all  recipes and recommend other paid healthy recipe apps (if vegetable juice)

     ![bg(6)](images/Background_and_Motivation/bg(6).jpg)

 6. Summary ：
     Overall, the app has a beautiful UI, user-friendly interaction, and offers a wide variety of recipes, making it a rare and good product for primal and gluten-free dieters. On this basis, if users can create and publish related recipes by themselves and implement certain social functions, it may improve the frequency of use and user stickiness of the product. At the same time, it can also enrich the recipe library.

## Problem definition

When considering the problem definition, we felt it was important to combat an issue that was both relevant and of real importance. 

On the one hand, according to the  [**Background literature**](#background-literature), we have learned that COVID-19 make a large number of people have to face unemployment ，financial crisis and spiritual crisis. Therefore, we think make a SPA product to help people reduce the cost of living and enrich people's spiritual world is very meaningful.

On the other hand, according to the [**State of the art survey**](#state-of-the-art-survey), we have learned that even the most popular food app at the moment still has many shortcomings, so we think that the food app has considerable market potential. For example，the **Paleo Plate** does not allow users to upload their own recipes, nor does it allow users to share their opinions, which is not conducive to enhancing user stickiness. Therefore，we hope our app can support users to create and publish related recipes by themselves and implement certain social functions, which can improve the frequency of use and user stickiness of the product. At the same time, it can also enrich the recipe library. 

In summary,our problem definition was people's financial crisis and spiritual crisis. Our proposed solution to this problem was to make a popular gourmet food's SPA to help people reduce the cost of living and enrich people's spiritual world.
